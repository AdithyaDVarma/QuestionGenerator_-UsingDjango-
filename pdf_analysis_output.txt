   "summary": "The backpropagation algorithm is a fundamental building block in neural networks, introduced in the 1960s and popularized in the 1980s. It is a supervised learning method used to train feedforward neural networks. The algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network weights and updates the weights to minimize the error between the system's output and the expected output. The algorithm consists of three stages: feed-forward of input training patterns, calculation and backpropagation of errors, and update of weights. The backpropagation algorithm is simple, fast, and easy to program, making it a popular choice for training neural networks. However, it is sensitive to noisy data and irregularities, and performance is highly dependent on input data.",
